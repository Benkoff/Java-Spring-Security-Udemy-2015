Created by Trevor Page. Last updated 6/2015

*The course is nice but a little bit outdated (last update is more than 2,5 years old) so I've decided to rewrite the main part with Spring 5 and recently released Spring Boot 2.0. Also I replace JSP with Thymeleaf and try to use it with Spring Security 5, which isn't officially supported by last Thymeleaf release yet.
